                The internet of things (IoT) connects physical machines and
                equipment in a factory to the digital world of cloud, data
                analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). It enables you to
                collect more data, analyze the information quickly and make
                better business decisions.
                <br>
                Forward-thinking manufacturers already know they need to bring
                IT closer to operational technologies that control machines and
                equipment. Traditionally, these technologies were managed by
                separate departments in relative isolation. Leaders, such as
                food and beverage giant Lion, have merged the teams to create a
                single integrated technology function to leverage synergies.

                Industry 4.0 advances in manufacturing are setting the standard for creating the
                smart factory and supply chain of the future using industrial IoT (IIoT), analytics,
                cloud computing and cyber physical systems. Manufacturers can now consider

                 Companies can create new products and
                services to generate additional revenue streams. Machines with IIoT
                sensors can gather huge amounts of data, and advanced analytics
                can transform it into “smart data” – that is, digital information that is
                formatted so that it can be acted upon at the collection point before
                being sent to a downstream analytics platform. Smart data can support
                decision making or can trigger actions automatically, and this value
                can be monetized. One of the most popular use cases is predictive
                maintenance of factory assets. If the organization servicing the assets
                is able to predict equipment failure, it can offer the predictions as an
                additional paid service.

                more attractive. IIoT-enabled parts, for example, are easier to find in a
                warehouse when used in conjunction with an indoor navigation system
                that can lead warehouse staff directly to their location. A smart product
                can determine when service levels are being exceeded or when it’s time
                for a maintenance check, potentially preventing a breakdown. The data
                generated by smart products also can be used to improve the service
                experience in the after-sales market by learning about customer usage

                the manufacturing process and products as they travel through a
                factory, enabling real-time control of the production system. While
                control systems have monitored factories for decades, it is now possible
                to make those systems more intelligent by feeding IIoT and business
                data into smart algorithms. In supply chain operations, sensors and IIoT

                higher revenue have been the only measurements of success for
                manufacturers, but today they are also being measured on corporate
                social responsibility. This means that the environmental impact of the
                production process and the products in use are areas of value creation.
                Examples of value include energy savings that result in a lower carbon
                footprint as well as the monitoring of air, soil and water quality. IIoT also
                can help monitor the environment, triggering alerts and even shutting

                 Risks are commonplace. Managing the
                risks effectively avoids the human tragedy and financial loss associated
                with accidents. IIoT sensors can be used to monitor the immediate
                environment around a worker, but can also measure a person’s vitals,
                such as heart rate, fatigue or stress. Knowing where an employee is
                located — together with health data, defined operational limits and data
                analytics — can help detect risks and issues in the work environment.

                be achieved through sensors and through autonomous vehicles with
                sensors, cameras, microphones and other technology needed to perform
                inspections. In larger facilities, drones can inspect the outside areas.
                Inspectors responsible for compliance can use IIoT systems to increase
                the inspection frequency and therefore detect compliance issues early
                on.

        With changes to the technology landscape and operating model, employees need to
learn new skills as their roles change. It is important that people understand IIoT and
Industry 4.0 concepts from both a business and technology perspective, establishing
a common language to minimize the risk of misunderstanding.
<br>
For the next level of detailed understanding of IIoT, focused programs that advance
employees’ capabilities need to be developed. In these programs, active participation
of the partner ecosystem, or value network, should be considered. A common
learning experience can improve and drive day-to-day collaboration.
