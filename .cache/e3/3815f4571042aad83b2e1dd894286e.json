Machines with IIoT\r\n                sensors can gather huge amounts of data, and advanced analytics\r\n                can transform it into “smart data” – that is, digital information that is\r\n                formatted so that it can be acted upon at the collection point before\r\n                being sent to a downstream analytics platform. Smart data can support\r\n                decision making or can trigger actions automatically, and this value\r\n                can be monetized. One of the most popular use cases is predictive\r\n                maintenance of factory assets. If the organization servicing the assets\r\n                is able to predict equipment failure, it can offer the predictions as an\r\n                additional paid service.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li class=\"item inside-grid\">\r\n          <div class=\"grid-image\">\r\n            <img class=\"section-imgs\" src=\"/0b3942b13a46dbcfc403dd28c7ce979b.jpg\">\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div class=\"grid-text\">\r\n            <h1>Customer experience.</h1>\r\n            <p class=\"text-inside\">\r\n                 IIoT can help make products and services\r\n                more attractive.

A smart product\r\n                can determine when service levels are being exceeded or when it’s time\r\n                for a maintenance check, potentially preventing a breakdown. The data\r\n                generated by smart products also can be used to improve the service\r\n                experience in the after-sales market by learning about customer usage\r\n                and preferences\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li class=\"item inside-grid\">\r\n          <div class=\"grid-image\">\r\n            <img class=\"section-imgs\" src=\"/324a53ae60e36097984c4d86f7050ec3.jpg\">\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div class=\"grid-text\">\r\n            <h1>Operational excellence.</h1>\r\n            <p class=\"text-inside\">\r\n                Sensors and actuators can closely monitor\r\n                the manufacturing process and products as they travel through a\r\n                factory, enabling real-time control of the production system. While\r\n                control systems have monitored factories for decades, it is now possible\r\n                to make those systems more intelligent by feeding IIoT and business\r\n                data into smart algorithms. In supply chain operations, sensors and IIoT\r\n                devices can track and trace products on their way from the factory to\r\n                the customer, anywhere in the world.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li class=\"item inside-grid\">\r\n          <div class=\"grid-image\">\r\n            <img class=\"section-imgs\" src=\"/cb871781bb1c740a9adff153891d9a68.jpg\">\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div class=\"grid-text\">\r\n            <h1>Environmental stewardship.</h1>\r\n            <p class=\"text-inside\">\r\n                 Traditionally, lower cost and\r\n                higher revenue have been the only measurements of success for\r\n                manufacturers, but today they are also being measured on corporate\r\n                social responsibility. This means that the environmental impact of the\r\n                production process and the products in use are areas of value creation.\r\n                Examples of value include energy savings that result in a lower carbon\r\n                footprint as well as the monitoring of air, soil and water quality.

It is important that people understand IIoT and\r\nIndustry 4.0 concepts from both a business and technology perspective, establishing\r\na common language to minimize the risk of misunderstanding.\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next level of detailed understanding of IIoT, focused programs that advance\r\nemployees’ capabilities need to be developed. In these programs, active participation\r\nof the partner ecosystem, or value network, should be considered.

Chief operating officers can get\r\n        new insights into the operation of the business, but they will want to understand\r\n        what the new data is and how to incorporate it into their decision making.

Maintenance\r\n        technicians will want to understand why predictive maintenance is important, and\r\n        how IIoT and data analytics will enable them to be more proactive with maintenance\r\n        inspection activities.</p>\r\n</div></div>\r\n\r\n</section> \r\n<section class=\"End-to-end\">\r\n    <div class=\"container\">\r\n        <div class=\"title-heading \">\r\n            <div class=\"white-square\">\r\n          <img src=\"/a6245dbc341dc3e99eeeb85a8890dc4b.jpg\" class=\"asset-number\">\r\n        \r\n        <h1 class=\"white\">End-to-end security</h1>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p class=\"text-inside\">\r\n        Vulnerabilities in self-driving cars get a lot of media attention and illustrate the\r\n        security concerns around IIoT. Smart factories are also at risk, and although\r\n        technology vendors are quick to provide security patches, the risks show that security\r\n        is often not built into the design of a production system. One of the reasons is that\r\n        those solutions were closed systems for decades and relatively safe from intruders.\r\n      </p><br>\r\n      <p class=\"text-inside\">In the past, manipulating machines in a factory typically required physical access\r\n        to the facility, but by linking assets to the internet and deploying IIoT capabilities,\r\n        facilities are now exposed to new security risks. New approaches for cyber-physical\r\n        systems are being developed that include authentication and encryption capabilities\r\n        built into hardware, real-time analytics of network traffic, and IIoT gateways that\r\n        serve as protective shields for factory equipment, similar to the way firewalls perform\r\n        in IT networks.<br>\r\n        With the convergence of IT and operational technology, “security by\r\n        design” is becoming a key decision criterion as companies choose technologies.\r\n        <br> They will want to learn about functionalities provided.</p>\r\n</div></div>\r\n\r\n</section> \r\n    </main>\r\n    <footer>\r\n      <p>&copy; 2020 DXC Technology Company 2020.
