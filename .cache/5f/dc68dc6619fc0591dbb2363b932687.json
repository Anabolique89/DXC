It enables you to collect more data, analyze the information quickly and make better business decisions. <br><br> Forward-thinking manufacturers already know they need to bring IT closer to operational technologies that control machines and equipment. Traditionally, these technologies were managed by separate departments in relative isolation. <br><br>Leaders, such as food and beverage giant Lion, have merged the teams to create a single integrated technology function to leverage synergies. </p> </div>  <div class=\"adventure-grid-item\"> <p> The next step is to harness technology to optimize the business and drive innovation. Industry 4.0 advances in manufacturing are setting the standard for creating the smart factory and supply chain of the future using industrial IoT (IIoT), analytics, cloud computing and cyber physical systems.<br><br> Manufacturers can now consider business model innovation and new revenue streams as they leverage the deluge of IoT data. <br><br>This is often called the servitization of the industry. The importance of Industry 4.0 and the IIoT is well understood, but how do you start implementing these concepts to maximize your chances of creating real value? </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class=\"success-factors\"> <div class=\"container\"> <div class=\"title-heading\"> <h1>Critical success factors</h1> <p class=\"intro-text\"><span class=\"capital\">E</span>arly discussions about IIoT primarily focused on the technology and what it could do, rather than on the business value IIoT could deliver.<span class=\"capital\">T</span>his is not surprising; IoT technologies’ cool factor has clearly captured people’s attention. <span class=\"capital\">M</span>ore recently, the conversations have shifted to the variety of business benefits IIoT can deliver.</p> <br> <p class=\"intro-text\"> <span class=\"capital\">T</span>here are six critical success factors organizations need to consider to successfully use <br> <span class=\"capital\">IIoT</span> in their digital transformation initiatives<strong> (Figure 1).</strong></p> </div> <img class=\"success\" src=\"d786d5478ce6ef4f19fdc3d5c7a06221.png\"> </div> </section>  <section class=\"slider-services\"> <div class=\"title-heading\"> <div class=\"white-square\"> <img src=\"9ca44fd4ac763d198751d20423f04564.png\" class=\"asset-number\"> <h1 class=\"white\">Business benefits</h1> </div> </div> <div class=\"app\"> <ul class=\"hs\"> <li class=\"item inside-grid\"> <div class=\"grid-image\"> <img class=\"section-imgs\" src=\"0d7d2a21a5d55b6aa6a7b9d910fda54a.svg\"> </div> <div class=\"grid-text\"> <h1>Business model innovation.</h1> <p class=\"text-inside\"> Companies can create new products and services to generate additional revenue streams. Machines with IIoT sensors can gather huge amounts of data, and advanced analytics can transform it into “smart data” – that is, <br><br> digital information that is formatted so that it can be acted upon at the collection point before being sent to a downstream analytics platform. <br> <br> Smart data can support decision making or can trigger actions automatically, and this value can be monetized. One of the most popular use cases is predictive maintenance of factory assets. If the organization servicing the assets is able to predict equipment failure, it can offer the predictions as an additional paid service. </p> </div> </li> <li class=\"item inside-grid\"> <div class=\"grid-image\"> <img class=\"section-imgs\" src=\"6fecde7a8281d7ca4905a1d2f6d452f5.svg\"> </div> <div class=\"grid-text\"> <h1>Customer experience.</h1> <p class=\"text-inside\"> IIoT can help make products and services more attractive. IIoT-enabled parts, for example, are easier to find in a warehouse when used in conjunction with an indoor navigation system that can lead warehouse staff directly to their location. <br><br> A smart product can determine when service levels are being exceeded or when it’s time for a maintenance check, potentially preventing a breakdown.
